The orginal howto is posted here: https://happycamper84.medium.com/let-credentialing-assistance-pay-your-sans-renewal-fees-1b4c306810b1

2 years after I wrote that walkthrough the DA terminated the original contract and hired a new company to run ArmyignitED. 

The updated howot for the new site is here: https://medium.com/@happycamper84/let-credentialing-assistance-pay-your-sans-renewal-fees-version-2-0-512c11a50b9f
